# GO-ing Full Stack CRUD Application

Welcome to the **GO-ing Full Stack** project! This repository contains the source code for a full-stack application built using **Go**, **React**, and **PostgreSQL**. It covers essential topics such as CRUD operations, logging, monitoring, and more, providing you with the tools to build a modern web application.

## Project Overview

This project is part of the **GO-ing Full Stack** series, where we build a full-stack CRUD application with the following key chapters:

1. **Building a CRUD App in Go**  
   - Building a simple REST API using Go.

2. **Building a React Front-End for a Go CRUD Application**  
   - Developing a React front-end to interact with the Go back-end.

3. **Adding PostgreSQL Support to the Go CRUD App**  
   - Integrating PostgreSQL to persist data.

4. **Seamless Logging Integration with Splunk in Our Go CRUD Application**  
   - Adding structured logging with Logrus and integrating with Splunk.

5. **Instrumenting the Go-CRUD App with Prometheus and Grafana**  
   - Tracking and visualizing application metrics using Prometheus and Grafana.
